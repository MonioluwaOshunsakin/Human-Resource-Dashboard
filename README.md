# Human-Resource-Dashboard
This Human Resource dashboard is designed to show the attrition rate of an organization

This human resource dashboard is designed to check the attrition rate of an organisation over a period of time.

This dashboard enables the HR team to track and analyse the employee turnover rate in real time.

This analysis encompasses several factors such as department, marital status, length of service, education background, and job roles.

The main objective of this study is to derive actionable insights that can help enhance HR practises and effectively tackle issues related to retrenchment and promotion within the organisation.

Having utilised datasets with details of 1470 employees, of which 1233 are active, this gives an attrition count of 237 and an attrition rate of 16.12%. This rate implies that 16% out of 100% of employees have left the organisation.

Based on the education field, the highest attrition count is in life science (89), and the least is in human resources (7).

The highest attrition count in the age group of 25â€“34 is 112,, and the lowest attrition count is in the age group of over 55 (11).

In conclusion, attrition counts provide valuable insights into the health and functioning of an organization. By analysing and understanding attrition trends, organisations can take proactive measures to improve their work environment, retain top talent, and ensure long-term success.
